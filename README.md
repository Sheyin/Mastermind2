# Mastermind

This is a clone of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastermind_(board_game)">Mastermindâ„¢</a>.  

I originally wrote up <a href="https://github.com/Sheyin/Mastermind">a version of this in Java</a> when I was learning to program; this version is written in C++ after taking CS161 and (hopefully...?) a bit better.  I will probably have a working version by later this afternoon.

<b>Still buggy</b> - I am still going through and fixing code written while I was half-awake!  Compiling now, but I need to fix some logical errors.

<b>Original goal:</b>
- writing this in C++
- having input validation (since I failed to add that in the original version)
 
<b>Challenges:</b>
- working with strings is driving me up the wall

<b>Current state:</b>
- compiling now, but I noticed some errors in the handling of duplicates.
- rather disorganized / duplicate code

<b>Long term goals:</b>
- absolutely want to have a GUI etc. but I'll need more than a week to start tackling that!
- modifiable difficulty (more complex codes, etc)
- time pressure (either real time or by turns)
- helper mode (gives some sort of hint... my beta-testers (lil nephews) suggested this)
- convert this into swift, since I'm dabbling with iOS currently
