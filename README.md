# Mastermind

This is a clone of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastermind_(board_game)">Mastermindâ„¢</a>.  

I originally wrote up <a href="https://github.com/Sheyin/Mastermind">a version of this in Java</a> when I was learning to program; this version is written in C++ after taking CS161 and (hopefully...?) a bit better.  

<b>Original goal:</b>
- writing this in C++
- having input validation (since I failed to have that working in the original version)
- simple C++ refresher for me
 
<b>Challenges:</b>
- working with strings is driving me up the wall
- it's amazing how rusty one can feel after ~2 weeks of not coding

<b>Current state:</b>
- working!  (I hope)
- probably still a bit messy to read / disorganized

<b>Long term goals:</b>
- absolutely want to have a GUI etc. but I'll need more than a week to start tackling that!
- modifiable difficulty (adjust number of colors, etc)
- time pressure (either real time or by turns)
- convert this into swift, since I'm dabbling with iOS currently
