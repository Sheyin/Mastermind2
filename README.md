# Mastermind

This is a clone of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastermind_(board_game)">Mastermindâ„¢</a>.  

I originally wrote up <a href="https://github.com/Sheyin/Mastermind">a version of this in Java</a> when I was learning to program; this version is written in C++ after taking CS161 and (hopefully...?) a bit better.  I will probably have a working version by later this afternoon.

<b>Not currently compiling</b> - I only wrote most of this up on post-it notes over a day or two, before realizing certain changes I made caused other complications.  I am still going through and fixing code written while I was half-awake!

<b>Original goal:</b>
- writing this in C++
- having input validation (since I failed to add that in the original version)
 
<b>Challenges:</b>
- working with strings is driving me up the wall

<b>Current state:</b>
- not quite compiling - string validation was giving me problems since I was using certain functions wrong.
- rather disorganized / duplicate code

<b>Long term goals:</b>
- absolutely want to have a GUI etc. but I'll need more than a week to start tackling that!
- modifiable difficulty (more complex codes, etc)
- time pressure (either real time or by turns)
- helper mode (gives some sort of hint... my beta-testers (lil nephews) suggested this)
- convert this into swift, since I'm dabbling with iOS currently
